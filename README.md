# MyReads Project

This the final assessment project for the React and Redux course in Udacity's React Nanodegree Program. It's an app that lets anyone create posts, browse posts all together or by category, vote on posts, comment on posts, and even vote on comments. 

Thing is, since there's no mechanism to identify, and subsequently regulate, who's doing what, it's a real free-for-all. You can impersonate people, you can vote for your own post a thousand times in a row, you can delete the whole site if you want. 

In the real world, this app would be taken over by zombies almost immediately. So it's a good thing that it's just a demo version.

## Oh and Hey One More Thing

I feel like there was something else I wanted to explain . . . I dunno, it's not springing to mind. Don't you hate that, when you know there's something important that you're forgetting, but you have no idea what it is? 

Like for some reason, I can never remember the name of the lead singer from Janes Addition. Can picture the dude real well, know exactly what he sounds like and the words he sings, but his name? Sorry man, says man's brain. Not going to give that one up.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
